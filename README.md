# Thar be dragons!

A little demo to illustrate different behaviors of 2 popular open-source custom `select` implementations against the native HTML `select`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

You can, but I don't know why you would.

### `yarn eject`

YOLO
